# [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2023 in [QBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic)

Solutions tested using QBasic 1.1. They should also be compatible with [QuickBASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickBASIC) 4.5, although I haven't tested yet.

Note: Input file end-of-line characters must be converted to DOS end-of-line characters to work, e.g., using a utility like `unix2dos`.
